  "summary": "The diff successfully implements REQ-11 by adding midnight (00:00) end time entries to both Day 1 and Day 2 schedules in Schedule.tsx. Both schedules now include a final '00:00' event labeled 'Event Ends' with a Clock icon, making the midnight end time clearly visible. The changes preserve the tournament/game lineup structure and maintain the dropdown functionality for day selection.",
